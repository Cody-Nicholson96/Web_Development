# Shaping Up With AngularJS

This is the AngularJS class I took on codeschool.com to prepare myself for work at CDK Global in June of 2017

Angular is a client-side JavaScript Framework for adding interactivity to HTML

You can download Angular at http://angularjs.org/ and bootstap at http://getbootstrap.com/
