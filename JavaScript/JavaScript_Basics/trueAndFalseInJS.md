#True and False in JavaScript

JavaScript has a very unique way of deciding between true and false

-

###A condition evaluates to true if it is

- true
- a non-zero number
- "Strings"
- objects
- arrays
- functions

-

###A condition evaluates to false if it is

- false
- 0
- ""
- undefined
- null
- not a number

-

Example values:

1 = true                  since it's a non-zero number
"Awesome" = true          since it's a string
undefined = false         since it's undefined
-42 = true                since it's a non-zero number
{"state":false} = true    since it's an object
[false] = true            since it's an array
