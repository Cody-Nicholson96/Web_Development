#Debugging Prit Statements

To do a print statement in js use:

```JavaScript
console.log("Enter text here");
```

This will print the message and also display 'undefined' to signal the coder that this statement des not return anything.

This command is useful for debugging because it allows you to test if a certain block of code ever gets executed.
