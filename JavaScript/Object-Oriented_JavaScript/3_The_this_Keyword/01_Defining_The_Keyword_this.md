# Defining The Keyword 'this'

'this' is an identifier that gets a value bound to it, much like a variable, but instead of identifying the values explicitly in your code, 'this' gets bound to the correct object automatically. The rules for how the interpreter determines the what the correct binding is resemble the rules for positional function parameters. The differences are designed to support your intuition about which object should be focal when you're invoking a method or a constructor.
