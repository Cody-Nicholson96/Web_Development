# The 'this' Keyword

Almost every object oriented language has a way to dynamically refer to the current object, and in JavaScript we can do this using the keyword 'this', but it can be confusing at times because it doesn't always return the object you are expecting it to

'this' is very much like a normal parameter, but it has two major differences:

1. You don't get to pick the name for the parameter 'this'
2. You go about binding values to the parameter 'this' differently than normal parameters
