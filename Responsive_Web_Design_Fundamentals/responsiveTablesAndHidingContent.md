Using the "display: none" statement in CSS you can hide certain elements at different viewport sizes

This is especially useful when making tables responsive

For example:


@media screen and (max-width: 123px)
{
    .classOfTableColumn
    {
        display: none;
    }
}

// If you have a table, like say a baseball record table, and you are viewing the table on a small viewport size, like a phone, it is useful to make certain columns disappear so you don't have too much info jammed into one place
// For example, on a phone it would probably not be necessary to view the scores for every single inning of the game, you would only only need to know the teams, the date, and the final score in your table


Another useful example:


@media screen and (max-width: 123px)
{
    table, thead, tbody, th, td, tr
    {
        display: block
    }
}

// Will display the table in a 'block' format so that your information is easy for viewers to look at


thead, tr
{
    position: absolute;
    top:-9999px;
    left:-9999px;
}

// Hides the table headers by positioning them off screen
// This is better than "display: none" because you will still see the table header in the browser


td
{
    position: relative;
    padding-left: 50%;
}

// Makes room for the header


td:before
{
    position: absolute;
    left: 6px;
    content: attr(data-th);
    font-weight: bold;
}

// This will add row labels
// The content attribute statement will pull values from the data-th of each of each of the td elements, Example: <td data-th="Team">...</td



Scrolling Tables CSS:


.contained_table
{
    width: 100%;
    overflow-x: auto;
}

// This will make it so that you can scroll to the right on a phone or small device to see the rest of a wide table
