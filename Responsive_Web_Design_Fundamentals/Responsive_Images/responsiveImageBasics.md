#Responsive Image Basics

Total bits = pixels * bits per pixel

Always go for less pixels with better compression

Loading images are one of the leading causes of slow loading lag on websites because they take up a lot of bandwidth and add latency if there are a lot of pictures

Max-width: 100% is one of the most basic and useful tools to adding responsive images to your page, it will make the width of the image take up 100% of its container, not the whole webpage!
