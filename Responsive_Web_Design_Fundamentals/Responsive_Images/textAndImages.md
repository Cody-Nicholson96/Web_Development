# Text and Images

If you ever need to add text to a webpage, it is better to overlay text on an image than to include the text in the image

When you overlay text on an image it will not blur when you zoom in, but when included in the image it will

Using CSS you can make a webpage look great without having to ever add pictures

Here are some cool css effects you can add to text:

```CSS
box-shadow: 5px 5px 20px 0 black;
border-radius: 100px;
animation: spin 2s;
```

CSS effects do cost additional runtime, but still save you runtime compared to pictures
