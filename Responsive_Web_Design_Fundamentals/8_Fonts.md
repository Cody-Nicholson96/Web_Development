# Fonts

A line of text should only be 65 characters long so that you don't overwhelm the reader with the text on your webpage

Fonts should be around "font-size: 16px;" and "line-height: 1.2em;" on a website

If your website is text heavy, you can go to a "font-size: 18px" and a "line-height: 1.25em"
