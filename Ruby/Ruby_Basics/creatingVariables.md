#Creating Variables

In Ruby you can create variables using the following syntax:

```ruby
myNum = 25
myBoolean = true
myString = "I am a string"
```

Notice that the syntax is very similar to Python in that you do not need to worry about ending every line with a semicolon

Everything in Ruby is an object, so all of these variables created above are objects
