# Print And Puts

### print

The print command will print a message to the screen/console

Example:

```ruby
print "This is a print example"
```

The output will be:

```
This is a print example
```

-

If you did to print statements in a row:

```ruby
print "Line one"
print "Still Line one"
```

The output would be:

```
Line oneStill Line one
```

So print statements will all print on the same line, if you want to print multiple lines you need to use **puts**

***

### puts

**Puts** behaves the same as **Print** but it adds a new line at the end of every statement

Example:

```ruby
puts "Line One"
puts "Line 2"
```

Output:

```
Line One
Line 2
```

***

By using **puts** and **print** together you can format the way your output text displays
