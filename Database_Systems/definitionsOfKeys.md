#Definition of Keys

A set of attributes X is a superkey of R if X determines all attributes of R

A set of attributes X  is a candidate key of R if it is a superkey, but no proper subset Y of X is a superkey

An attribute is prime if it is contained in some candidate key (and is non-prime otherwise)
