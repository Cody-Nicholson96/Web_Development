#Restrictions

The restriction of a relation state r to a set S is the set of distinct tuples obtained from r by including only the attributes in S in each tuple

Restrictions whose sets S overlap can be combined by taking a natural join on their shared attributes

Ideally, this should yield a result that is still a restriction of the original relation state râ€¦
