#Database Programming

Three main approaches:

    1. Embed database commands in a general programming language

    2. Create a library of database functions in an API (e.g., JDBC)

    3. Design a general programming language that includes database commands (e.g., PL/SQL)

First two approaches can suffer from impedance mismatch
