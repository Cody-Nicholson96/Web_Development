# Database Programming In PL/SQL

PL/SQL is Oracle’s version of  the SQL/PSM (“Persistent Stored Modules”) standard

PL/SQL is a procedural programming language that includes SQL – it can:

- create and issue SQL statements

- store and process the results of queries

- define triggers to respond to database events, as well as other named procedures and functions

***

### Database Programming in PL/SQL

Three places PL/SQL code can go:

1. Within a trigger that is executed in response to database events

2. Within a procedure or function that is executed when called by name

3. Within an anonymous block that is executed directly by a user

***

### Anonymous Block

Will be executed directly, like an SQL script:

```
    declare
           -- variable and subprogram declarations
    begin
           -- PL/SQL statements to execute
           -- each statement must end with a semicolon
    exception
           -- exception handling (optional)
    end;
    /
```
***

### PL/SQL Statements

- Output (dbms_output.put_line)

- Variable declarations and assignments

- Branching (if, if-then, if-elseif, case)

- Looping (general, while, for)

- Cursors (regular, parameterized, records)

***

### PL/SQL Procedures

```
CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE name
  (paramName IN [OUT] paramType …) AS
  …declarations…
BEGIN
    …body of procedure…
END;
/
```

‘IN’ parameters are passed by value, for input only…

‘IN OUT’ parameters are passed by reference, to return results…

***

### PL/SQL Functions

```
CREATE [OR REPLACE] FUNCTION
  name  (paramName IN paramType …)
  RETURN returnType AS …declarations…
BEGIN
    …body of function…
    return returnValue;
END;
/
```

No ‘OUT’ parameters, only ‘IN’ parameters

Specify return type and return value instead

***

### Output

To display output:

- dbms_output.put_line(string);

Output buffer displayed in DBMS Output tab

- Use View -> Dbms Output and ‘+’ to open tab

Concatenation of strings uses ||

***

### Declaring Variables

All variables must be declared:

```
varName dataType [:= initialValue];
```

SQL data types are available (e.g., number, char, varchar2), plus binary_integer and boolean

Assignments use :=, and PL/SQL has typical arithmetic operations

-

Only one variable can be declared per line, but variable types can be given in terms of the domain of another variable or attribute:

```
varName otherVar%type;
varName TABLE.Attribute%type;
```

Can use substitution variables (e.g., &X) to prompt user for values

***

### Branching

if-then:

```
if condition then
        …’true’ statements…
end if;
```

-

if-else:

```
if condition then
    …’true’ statements…
els
    …’false’ statements…
end if;
```

-

if-elsif:

```
if condition1 then
    … ‘t’ statements…
elsif condition2 then
    … ‘f-t’ statements…
elsif condition3 then
    … ‘f-f-t’ statements…
(… as many times as needed…)
else
    … ‘all f’ statements…
end if;
```

-

Case:

```
case variable
when value1 then
    … ‘value1’ statements…
when value2 then
    … ‘value2’ statements…
(… as many times as needed…)
else
   … ‘nomatch’ statements…
end case;
```

***

### Loops

General loop:

```
loop
    …loop body…
end loop;
```

Repeats until exit; is executed in loop body

-

While loop:

```
while condition loop
   …loop body…
end loop;
```

Repeats until condition is false

-

For loop:

```
for variable in [reverse] lower..upper loop
        …loop body…
end loop;
```

Can only increment/decrement by one

lower always appears before upper in header

***

### Incorporating SQL Queries

Result of a query can be stored in a set of variables by adding INTO clause to query

Variable types must match attribute types

Query must return a single record

```
SELECT list of attributes
INTO list of variables
FROM list of tables
…
```

***

### Cursors

A cursor represents a pointer into a set of records returned by a query

```
cursor name is query;
```

Cursor name can be used to iterate through the records returned by query

-

### Cursor Commands/Expressions

```
open name;
    -- initializes to beginning of set

fetch name into variableList;
    -- reads the next record into the variables

close name;
    -- closes the cursor

name%found
    -- true if last call to fetch succeeded

name%rowcount
    -- number of records successfully fetched
```

***

### Parameterized Cursors

Can supply a parameter in cursor declaration and query

```
cursor name (parameter in type) is query;
```

Each time cursor is opened, a value of the parameter must be specified in parentheses to complete the query

***

### Records

Can declare a record with the same structure as a table row (fields are table attributes):

```
recordName TABLE%rowtype;
```

Can select a row of a table directly into a record, and access individual fields with

```
recordName.Attribute
```

***

### Cursor For Loop

To iterate through all of the rows returned by a query:

```
for recordName in cursorName
    …loop body…
end loop;
```

The needed record must be declared, but open/fetch/close can be omitted in this loop

***

### Procedures

```
CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE name
  (paramName IN [OUT] paramType …) AS
  …declarations…
    BEGIN
        …body of procedure…
END;
/
```

‘IN’ parameters are passed by value, for input only…

‘IN OUT’ parameters are passed by reference, to return results…

***

### Functions

```
CREATE [OR REPLACE] FUNCTION
  name  (paramName IN paramType …)
  RETURN returnType AS …declarations…
BEGIN
    …body of function…
    return returnValue;
END;
/
```

No ‘OUT’ parameters, only ‘IN’ parameters

Specify return type and return value instead

***

### Review Oracle Trigger Syntax

```
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER Name
  BEFORE/AFTER INSERT OR DELETE OR UPDATE [OF Attribute]
  ON Table
[REFERENCING
        OLD AS OldName
        NEW AS NewName]
[FOR EACH ROW]
[WHEN (condition)]
BEGIN
    PL/SQL statements
END;
/
```

-

#### BEFORE

Indicates that queries on TABLE will be done on the state of the table before the triggering operation executes

#### AFTER

Indicates that queries on TABLE will be done on the state that the table would be in after the triggering operation executes

-

#### INSERT OR DELETE OR UPDATE [OF Attribute] ON TABLE

What operation(s) will cause the trigger to fire?

Trigger will fire in response to any INSERT or DELETE

Trigger may be set to fire in response to any UPDATE, or only an UPDATE of a particular attribute

-

#### REFERENCING OLD AS OldName, NEW AS NewName

The original and modified states of the row being operated upon are called “old” and “new” unless you change them (for row-level triggers only!)

- INSERT has only “new”, but no “old”

- DELETE has only “old”, but no “new”

- UPDATE has both “old” and “new”

-

#### FOR EACH ROW

If not included, indicates a statement-level trigger that will fire just once for the entire operation

If included, indicates a row-level trigger that will fire once for each row that is modified

- … so an UPDATE or DELETE that applies to multiple rows will cause the trigger to fire more than once for the operation …

-

#### WHEN (condition)

Condition tested to see whether or not the trigger action will actually execute

- Statement-level: will query original or modified table state depending on whether BEFORE or AFTER is used

- Row-level: can reference original and modified row states with “old” and “new” (INSERT has only “new”, DELETE has only “old”, UPDATE has both!)

-

#### PL/SQL statements

This block of code is executed when the trigger fires and the WHEN condition is satisfied

It may include:

- SQL statements

- PL/SQL statements

- Calls to built-in or user-defined procedures/functions

***

### Oracle Trigger Restrictions

new and old can only refer to row states, so they can only be used for row-level triggers

- Use new and old in WHEN condition, but :new and :old elsewhere
Subqueries are not allowed in WHEN

PL/SQL statements in a row-level trigger cannot query or modify the table that triggered the action

***

### Trigger Examples

#### Salary Cap:

Cancel any operation that will cause the sum of the salaries to exceed $1,000,000 (review Salary Cap example…)

#### Logging:

Keep a record of all operations performed on a table (add to Department Budgets example…)

#### Insuring Referential Integrity:

If a record is being added that would violate referential integrity, add a row with the needed primary key to the other table first! (add to Department Budgets example…)
