#What is a database?


Data is info that can be recorded and has known meaning
<br>
A database is an organized collection of logically related data that are typically:

- Persistent and stored on a stable medium
- Shared and have multiple uses and interested users
- Interrelated and form a bigger picture

***

###Why use a database system?
-

Early data processing systems used files of data in plain text form
<br>
Problem: program-data dependence led to limited data sharing, duplication of data, excessive time for development

***

A database uses a single repository of data acessed by multiple users
<br>
It contains info on the structure of the data
<br>
Supports different views of and concurrent access to the data
<br>
Allows sharing of and concurrent access to data

-

The costs are higher overhead for the design, implementation, and maintenance of the data

***

###Benefits:
-

- Program-data independance
- Controlled data redundancy
- Controlled access to data
- Support for multiple users
- More efficient query processing
- Faster application development

***

###Database Management Systems:
-

DBMS: Oracle, IBM DB2, MS Access/SQL Server, MySQL
<br>
We can work with a DBMS directly or through an application that supplies a particular interface (e.g., SQLDeveloper)
<br>
The database and DBMS together make up a database system
