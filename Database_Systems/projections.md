#Projections

Suppose we have a set of functional dependencies F in the relation R

For some Ri, consider all X -> Y in F+ such that both X and Y are subsets of Ri

This set is called the projection of  F on Ri

The projection represents the set of all constraints that F puts on the attributes of Ri
