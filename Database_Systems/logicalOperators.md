# Logical Operators

Simple conditions can be combined into more complicated conditions

X AND Y is true for a tuple if and only if both X and Y are true for it

X OR Y is true for a tuple if and only if at least one of X and Y is true for it

NOT X is true for a tuple if and only if X is false for it
