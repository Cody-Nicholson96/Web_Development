CSS:

max-width: 100%;
Will make sure your images will always adjust to fit in the viewport by always being at least as wide as the viewport width.

margin-right: 10px;
width: calc((100% - 10px)/2);
This code is meant for the img tag and will put images side by side with a 10px margin between them.

width: 100vw;
Will make the webelement width equal to 100% of the viewport width

height: 100vw;
Will make the webelement height equal to 100% of the viewport height

width: 100vmin;
height: 100vmin;
Will adjust the width/height to always be equal or less to the viewport width/height

width: 100vmax;
height: 100vmax;
Will adjust the width/height to always be equal or greater than the viewport width/height

Image types:

Raster - From a camera a grid of colored dots, blurs easily, use JPEG or WebP file format
Vector - an image consisting of defined shapes, lines, and colors, does not blur, use SVG/PNG file format (not gif)

Workflow Notes:

Don't use large pictures unless your users will be scaling that picture up. Larger images that are scaled down take up more space and load slower.
