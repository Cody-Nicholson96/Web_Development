# How To Make Unit Tests Speak The Truth

- As a general rule, only include one assertion per test so that you are only ever targeting one feature with one test rather than multiple
- Test output produces clear documentation, make sure you have a good naming convention
- Tests are simple and understandable at a glance
- Tests are treeated like code: refactored, optimized, and improved

***

Tests aren't just about testing the code, they are about communication

If your test communicates well, then it has value in telling the world it is doing
