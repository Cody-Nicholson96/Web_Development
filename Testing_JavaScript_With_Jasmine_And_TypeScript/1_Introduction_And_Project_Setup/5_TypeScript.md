# TypeScript

TypeScript is known and named for its static-typing capabilities. This gives you all kinds of help and documentations in design real-time. You also get to use ES6 features that all browsers haven't assimilated yet and future ES7 features. This helps future-proof your code and prepares you for what is new in JavaScript. TypeScript gives you immediate feedback on the validity of your code.
